# Environmental-impact-of-10grs-of-Food-Production-

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the environmental impact of producing 10 grams of protein from various sources of food production. The impact of food production on the environment is a growing concern, and this project aims to shed light on the extent of this impact. In this project, we will be using R programming to clean, analyze, and plot data.

We will analyze the environmental impact of producing 10 grams of protein from different sources, including animal-based proteins (such as beef, chicken, and pork), plant-based proteins (such as soy and lentils), and alternative protein sources (such as insects and lab-grown meat). We will use a life cycle assessment approach to evaluate the impact of each protein source, taking into account factors such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, and energy consumption. R programming will be used to clean and analyze the data, as well as to create visualizations of the results.

By the end of this project, we expect to have a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact of producing 10 grams of protein from various sources of food production. The use of R programming will enable us to efficiently and effectively analyze the data, and create visualizations that will help communicate the findings.
